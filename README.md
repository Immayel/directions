# directions
 The second task I do it during the summer. in Smart methods company.
 •	Control interface design for moving the robot base.
•	Create database to control robot base.
•	Create PHP pages to connect the database with the hardware (the database).
•	Integrating the control panel into a single panel interface.
•	Convert the interface or display it as a mobile web view.
This interface will control the direction of the robot. The robot will move to forward, backward, left, right, or stop moving. There are five buttons on the interface that will control the moving process. I create a very simple interface by using HTML and CSS. I create a database on XAMPP, and I connected the database with the hardware using PHP. In the end, I convert the interface to a mobile web view by using CSS.
